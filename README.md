# Micromouse
This project involves a microprocessor robotic "mouse" that traverses through a maze. The robot starts out in the bottom left corner of the maze. The robot is programmed with an algorithm that uses distance sensors on the front, left, and right side in order to track itself through each step of the traversal. The sensors also keep the robot in line with the walls when moving. Once the mouse reaches the center of the maze, it will then continually spin until turned off.
